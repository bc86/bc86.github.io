When you hear CMS what do you think of? If your like me it's usually Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal or Magento.

During a job interview I learned about a different CMS that I haven't heard of before. That CMS is called Craft. So it's now a week after the interview and I figured I would share what I've learned about Craft.

First things first, I had no idea how many CMS's there are. I read an article that said there are over 150 different CMS's in the wild. Quickly for anyone that doesn't know what CMS stands for. CMS or Content Management System, is a software application or set of related programs that are used to create and manage digital content. Throughtout this blog I'll probably compare Craft with Wordpress because of how popular Wordpress is. Wordpress powers 26% of the sites currently online.

### Installation and Setup

Craft 3 was released on April 4th. Craft like alot of CMS's use the PHP programming language. But also relies on the Yii framework and Twig templating engine. Craft relies on the MVC, Model View Controller, pattern and as a result of this load speeds are incredible. Craft has a great tutorial on getting started and [installation](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/installation.html). It also discusses some requirements expected of your server. Go look over their instructions and then come back and if you followed the instructions you should eventually be greeted with a congratulatory image similar to this.

Now that we have the editor installed let's look at it's features.

### Craft editor and preview

Let me mention at the beginning, I've only downloaded the demo version of Craft 3. So I don't have access to all the features that Craft offers but at least the demo gives a good working example. Craft's matrix is great for laying out, any and all types of, your information. A great feature I noticed is localization. Craft's site content can be targeted at specific languages and territories. But what really impressed me was Live Preview. I felt Live Preview was very powerful. You have the ability to check break points of your page constantly. This is a great way to check the progress of your page without a rude awakening come launch day.

Craft also gives you an image editor in house. This editor not only gives you the ability to crop, rotate but also to set the focal point of the image. In the process of better understanding Craft, I came across an article. In this article it mentioned that

> when someone can develop in Craft CMS, you know that they have a certain level of skill

It made me wonder why this was the case and then I saw the description on Craft about templating. Craft said 

> We provide the back end, but the front end of your site is completely up to you. **Because themes are for wussies**.

Oh I see why now. It's because Craft doesn't just hold your hand like some other CMS like Wordpress. You need to bring your Front-end game to Craft. Another great feature Craft brings is the ability to edit multiple sites with one Craft download. Right within the editor you have the ability to change and create several sites at the same time. 

But what if basic Craft is missing something you wish it had? Ah the plugin store to the rescue. If you need something I'll bet you your paycheck that the plugin store has that covered for you. From optimizing images to implementing GraphQL with Craft, the plugin store has you covered.

As developers we know how important SEO is. Craft has SEO covered also. We know Wordpress has Yoast SEO, but Craft covers you with both SEOmatic and SproutSEO.

Ok another comparison. Wordpress covers eCommerce with WooCommerce. What does Craft offer? Just another plugin? Nope. Craft has a whole nother Craft Commerce to cover all your sales needs. Now I didn't get a chance to work with Craft Commerce but if it's anything like Craft 3 it won't disappoint. 

### Greatness isn't Free

'What's all this gonna cost you?', you say. Well for Craft if your looking for a solo account that's free. But if your looking to add user accounts then you'll have to upgrade to Pro and that will cost you $299 initially plus $59 per year for updates. Ok now for the painful part. For Craft Commerce you'll have to pay out a good bit more. To gain a site license for Craft Commerce you'll have to shell out $999. But if you want the pro version that'll cost you $1298. Not the cheapest in the world but you get what you pay for. 

Ok it's time to wrap this blog up. As I continue to learn more about Craft I'll have to look into adding my own PHP code to the project and look more into the plugin store. So that's it for now, but I look forward to the next blog. But for now I'm outta here.
