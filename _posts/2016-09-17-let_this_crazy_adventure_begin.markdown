You read so many different blog posts describing why this person or that person wants to learn about software development or in layman's term \'coding\'.  Either it's they're driven by passion or they're gonna use that knowledge to change the world.

Well guess what, here's another post with a little bit of both.  I remember ever since I was a little kid I liked taking things apart and tinkering with them, seeing what was inside and how they worked and usually, at that age, no longer having something because I couldn't put it back together.  That philosophy has carried on throughout my entire life, well except for the fact that I've gotten better at reassembling things.

The first computer I remember working with, my dad brought home, it was a windows computer and I remember we spent most of our time inserting and pulling floppy disks.  It was the beginning of my fascination with all things technology.  Between working on my hand-me-down monochrome screen computer and playing some word game on a computer where you run from monsters or something, I've always wondered how those things worked behind the scenes.

Ok now fast forward to today.  So what do you do if you wonna find a job in computers in general but you didn't go to college for it.  That's where I kinda found myself.  Kind of a catch-22, I need experience to get a job but I need a job to get experience.  Sure there are internships or the like but when you're married with bills those ideas just don't cut it.  So where do I start?  At the time I wasn't sure.  I started out self teaching myself CompTIA A+ to the point that I passed both tests to become certified A+.  Then I moved into Web Design.  Through study I learned HTML, CSS and some Javascript.  I learned enough to design my Dad's automotive web site.  But that wasn't good enough.  Just knowing the barebones of something has never really sufficed for me.  I wonna understand more than just the front-end. I wonna know what goes on behind the scenes or back-end.  

So I say it again let this crazy adventure begin.  I'm on my way to actually becoming what I want to be.  Flatiron has been a great stepping stone so far for my endeavors.  I'm loving every second of it and looking forward to the next adventure.
